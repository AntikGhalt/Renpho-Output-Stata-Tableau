# Renpho-Output-Stata-Tableau
This is one of my first projects, completed in 2022.

The first part prepares the code for merging different data sources

The second part modifies the variables to extract information from raw data

The third part prepares data for the Tableau exportation
    Then data are readable with that Tableau Dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/views/Renphodata/Story?:language=it-IT&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
